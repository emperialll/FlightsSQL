Module: Data Processing and Storage

This module handles data processing using the 'datetime' module and data storage
with the help of the 'sqlalchemy' library. It also imports a module named 'data'
that likely contains specific data-related functionalities.

Imported Modules:
    datetime
        Provides classes for working with dates and times, including creating,
        parsing, and formatting date and time objects.

    sqlalchemy
        A powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
        It facilitates database connection, query execution, and data manipulation.

    data
        (Replace with a brief description of the 'data' module's purpose.)

Functions:
    process_data(date: datetime) -> processed_data
        Processes the input date using functions from the 'data' module and returns
        the processed data.

Classes:
    (Add descriptions of any classes defined in the 'data' module, if applicable.)

Example:
    from datetime import datetime
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    import data

    input_date = datetime(2023, 8, 10)
    processed_data = process_data(input_date)

    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///mydatabase.db")
    connection = engine.connect()
    connection.execute(sqlalchemy.text("INSERT INTO processed_data 
    VALUES (:data)"), data=processed_data)
    connection.close()
